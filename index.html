      <p> <b>Hi,</b>
          

          My name is Valeria Obregon Guillermo,
          I'm 18 years old and during this period of life I've learned that education and being prepared for every oportunity
          that comes in my way is very important now a days, so sense a year and a half ago I been preparing my self 
          as much as I can.
          I started taking courses about trading on the Stock Market and Forex,
          I've taken a couple courses on neurolinguistic progrmaing, as well as 
          oral expression and a couple more courses on self development,etc.
          but I've got to admit that this course has probably been the most challenging
          for me and I'm happy that everyday I'm getting better.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
